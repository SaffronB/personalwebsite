  	I'm Saffron. I'm from South Africa and while growing up I spent my time between Johannesburg and the arid Karoo. I've lived in both Taiwan and England but nothing beats home and now I'm happily living in Cape Town with two cats and one boyfriend.

	'What do I do?' The answer to that is nothing specific and everything in general. Well not quite everything.  I studied both International Relations and Politics and am now a travel analyst. I also have a passion (maybe not a talent) for startups and have been involved in several side projects- I'm currently trying to learn how to code to speed up this process.

	If you can't find me infront of my laptop thinking about what to do next, you'll find me gardening, watching period series or planning my next swim.
